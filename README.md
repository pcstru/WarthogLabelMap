"# WarthogLabelMap"

Program takes a CSV file and uses info to apply labels to images of the
thrustmaster warthog throttle and stick. Example CSV file is wartysetuped.csv (this was generated from the default Elite Dangerous settings)

Put everything somewhere, load Warty.html into a browser. Use the form button to select the .csv file and then click on the loadfile button.

The script in the HTML file loads the data from the CSV and creates div's with text labels. The divs have a style applied which matches the styles in the Warty.css file. The Warty.css classes tell the labels where to position themselves with respect to the image.
